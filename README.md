  The music process is grueling, lonely and can lack perspective. Many musicians are perfectionists and only show their final product and release it without any outside opinions. Think about it: if you want your song to appeal to the masses, shouldn’t you get input from the masses? Crowdfunding has brought the world some of the most innovative products ever created. If the creative process is democratized, then the contributor will be more invested in the final product. Music itself has a monetization problem— and Vibro seeks to fix that.
